# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions to Advent of Code 2022 written in Ruby.

A full series of walkthrough videos is available on my [YouTube channel here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMqshdJjWZdnBVsf8PfsY9SaaXRiuliEj).

## Instructions

To run a given part and day, run the following from the root:

```bash
./run 1 1 input
```

First parm is day number, second is part number and third is input type, either `sample` or `input`.
